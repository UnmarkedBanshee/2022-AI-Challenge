# 2022-AI-Challenge
SW Swift Test repo.
I created this to grasp a basic understanding of GitHub's features.


## Why Use GitHub?
 - Source control
  - Changes to any file can be viewed.
  - Files can be reverted to a previous version.
  - People can work on the same file async.
 - Bugs and problems can be tracked and reported from the "Issues" sections
 - Allows for webserver hosting (essentially you can make a website and host it on GitHub)
 - Code will be open source


## Getting set up with Github
 * Every repo has a "main" branch. This is the only branch that we will use for this project.
 * I would like you to download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
 * After installing it, open it up and clone this repo. There will be a green button on the top right of this page.
  * __Cloning__ downloads the code of this repo to your computer.
  * After you've cloned it, open the folder in VSCode (or whatever IDE you use)
  * As you write your code, GitHub and VSCode will track all of the changes that you have made
  * Once you have completed a new idea or fixed a _specific_ bug(s), then you are ready to publish your code.


### Publishing Your Changes
 - Open up GitHub Desktop
 - The repo should already be open. If not, then open the folder
 - You must *add* all of the files that you have changed. The files that you select here will be the ones that are uploaded to GitHub.
 * Once they are added, you can press the **commit** button. The button is likely under the "*repository*" tab in GitHub Desktop
  * *note:* It will ask you for a message. This message should be a breif and general summary of what you have done in this commit.
- **Commit**ing changes will make those changes locally, now you must **push** the change to the Cloud, likely under the "*repository*" tab as well.
- Now you can check the repo online and see your changes :)


## What You Should Do:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Creates a python file called "*test.py*"
3. Create a "Hello World" program.
4. Add, commit, and push it to this repo.
